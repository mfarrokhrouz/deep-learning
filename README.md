In this work, the deep learning of the charity data is done.

Data cleaning performed on the input data to exclude the outliers both in the features and in the target.

Besides, the X values were determined and scaled to minimix=ze the effect of the data range on the final neural network model.

The results of the Neural Network was saved as result.h5 file.
